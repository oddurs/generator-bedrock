# Contributing to <%= repo %>

Looking to contribute something to <%= repo %>? **Here's how you can help.**

## Reporting issues

We only accept issues that are icon requests, bug reports, or feature requests. Bugs must be isolated and reproducible problems that we can fix within the Font Awesome core. Please read the following guidelines to ensure you are the paragon of bug reporting.

1. **Search for existing issues.** We get a lot of duplicate issues, and you'd help us out a lot by first checking if someone else has reported the same issue. Moreover, the issue may have already been resolved with a fix available.
2. **Create an isolated and reproducible test case.** Be sure the problem exists in <%= repo %>'s code with a [reduced test case](http://css-tricks.com/reduced-test-cases/) that should be included in each bug report.
3. **Include a live example.** Make use of jsFiddle, jsBin, or Codepen to share your isolated test cases.
4. **Share as much information as possible.** Include operating system and version, browser and version, version of <%= repo %>, etc. where appropriate. Also include steps to reproduce the bug.

## Key branches

- `master` is the latest, deployed version (not to be used for pull requests)
- `gh-pages` is the hosted docs (not to be used for pull requests)
- `*-wip` branches are the official work in progress branches for the next releases. All pull requests should be submitted against the appropriate branch

## Pull requests

- Submit all pull requests against the appropriate `*-wip` branch for easier merging
- Try not to pollute your pull request with unintended changes--keep them simple and small
